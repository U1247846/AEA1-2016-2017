**Final Python Assignment:**

The python file is quite large, so it might not load in github. In any case, this [link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/U1247846/AEA1-2016-2017/blob/master/MonopolyV5.ipynb) to the python-file should work. Alternatively you can download the contents of this repository and load it from your desktop. Included in this repository is also the excel file with the transition matrix.
